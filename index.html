<p>Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin was founded in 2002 after long-time spouses, Christie and Chris, realized a real need in their own lives. Christie came from a family that cooked and knew their way around a kitchen, however, Chris came from the complete opposite. Chris did not have a clue what he was doing when it came time to cook dinner. Christie applauded Chris's motivation to learn, but she simply didn't have the time to tech Chris herself. This sparked the idea for Christie and Chris's Cooking Cabin. Now, with their company's products and services, Chris can learn how to cook on his own time (even picking up a few special tricks of his own). After hitting the ground running, Christie and Chris are cooking every meal together and inspiring others to learn the art of cooking!</p>
